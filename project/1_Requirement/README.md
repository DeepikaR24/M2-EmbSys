# REQUIREMENT:
## Introduction:
  Irrigation plays a vital role in growing healthy crop/plant. As technology advanced, irrigation system can also be automically done without the help of human by the smart irrigation method. Here I use Arduino and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) module the contol to irrigation method by the user. Arduino is pre-programmed for particular crop/plant mouister content with the help of that we could water the crop as per the water need. The entire irrigation happens in a smart way with the help of technologies by the control of User.
## Research:
 The steady increasing requirement for food requires rapid development in food production technology. There is awide range of crops and plants with different varieties. Various
crops and plants have different requirements for water, fertilizers and sunlight .In a country like India, much of the economy is based on agriculture. India thrives on agriculture and farmers work day and night for the best productivity of crops. But they might be having problems in farming during natural hazards and the scheduled watering of the crops can get hampered. The main reason is lack of rain and shortcoming of land reservoir water. The continuous water removal results in the reduction of water from the earthâ€™s surface. As a result this leads to the increase of uncultivated land. Water wastage is also a big concern that the world faces. Nowadays water shortage is increasing day by day as a result saving water is also a topic of concern nowadays. Therefore smart irrigation system has been proposed and designed so that the plants or crops can be supplied with water in a proper time interval.
## Benefits:
  * Crop to grow healthy by smart irriagation system by getting water automaticaaly.
  * Reduce of water wastage.
  * No need to work and check the crop manually.
## Explanation:
  * Set Soil Moisture Content level of particular crop/plant.
  * Pre Program data about soil Moisture level of particular Crop to Arduino.
  * Set Water tank level by Water level sensing circuit.
  * Check Moisture content.
  * Send SMS Alert through GSM module to User.
  * If Mouisture in normal range then leave as it is.
  * If No water in tank, switch on pump 2 constructed by DC motor with the help of Relay 2 to refill untill the water reaches highest level from reserviour.
  * If Low Mouisture, Switch on pump 1 consturcted by DC motor with the help of Relay 1 to supply water.
  * Supply Water to crop untill the moisture sensor reaches normal level of moisture.
  * Crop always gets water supply when moisture level decrease.
  * This process happen every 5 mintues to check the condition of moisture crop.

 #### Who
  This handled by the User techically by using GSM module connected to arduino. 
 #### What 
  Every single condition of crop is virtually viewed by user by sending alert SMS to user.
 #### When
  The decision is to be taken by user when SMS alert arrives accrodingly to crop moisture content and water tank level.
 #### Where 
  Without any manual working this irrigation method is smartly handled every where.
 #### How
  Soil Moisture sensor sense the moisture content in the crop sent information to the arduino then forward SMS to user through the GSM.
  If moisture level is low then turn pump on, supply water to crop. If water tank level is low or not in level to irrigate then information goes to user and set to fill the       tank first from reserviour to irrgate.
