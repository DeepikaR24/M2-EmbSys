# AUTOMATIC DOOR OPENING SYSTEM
## Description:
  Our system puts forward an automatic and precise door opening system based on human movement sensing near the door. Well opening a door in places like hotels, Shopping complexes, and offices can be a tedious task and sometimes requires hiring a person just for the sake of opening door whenever a person arrives but now the techologies has been modernized by getting advantages from that implemented automatic Door Opener When a living being arrives within the sensor range, it detects its presence and sends out a command that opens the door.   
## Research:
 ### State of art
  * The system can be later enhanced by integrating counter mechanism so as to keep track of the number of persons inside the facility.
  * It may mainly intended to automated security access operations using a mobile phone.
  * The availability of accessories has increased, including such features as wireless keypads, key chain remotes, and solenoid-operate deadbolts to lock the door itself.
  * Door activation over the Internet to allow home owners to open their garage door from their office for deliveries.
## Cost
  * This system is implemented at an economical price and the cost is very less to install the project.
  * Needs High maintainance.
## Features
* To sense and detect the motion of human coming closer to the door.
* To Open the door when motion gets detected.
* To Close the door until there is no motion detection.
* To Close the door after the few seconds of door opening.
 ## SWOT Anlaysis:
  ![SWOT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98866123/157143115-a11939fd-6ba1-4b4c-ba1b-6cf11cc1f617.PNG)
  #### Strengths
   * Automatic Door Opener by human sensed is convenience for passage
   * Barrier free for wheelchair using persons, hygiene control, energy saving, environmental protection and hands free.
   * Safety and Security purpose.
  #### Weaknesses
   * They are also more complex to clean since you also need to polish internal parts like springs and bolts to avoid the accumulation of rust.
   * The installation process requires the help of a professional door technician in order for it to be accurate and efficient.
   * Thses are more expensive than standard doors, but the expense may be worth it when you consider all of the benefits. These doors also require more maintenance that              adds to the expense of these doors.
 #### Opportunities
   * The scope of this system is huge in enterance of many places.
   * Can be used where we need simple automatic door opener by motion sensing.
 #### Threats
   * When power goes off this system disables unless we have an inverter.
  
## 5 W's & 1'H:
![5W   1H](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98866123/157143833-e8fe8c67-67f7-45a7-8da8-200e532b0c4d.PNG)

 ##### Who
   * The Automatic Door Opening is accessible by everyone from young to elder people.
   * Specially this system is neccesity for physically disable and wheelchaired people.
 ##### What
   * Automatic Door Openning system is simple automated system, wherein the door is robotically opened up on detecting human and robotically closes after a few time.
 ##### When
   * This system is when someone want to enter.
 ##### Where 
   * Placed in enterance places of every where like entrance of home, hospital, shopping mall.
 ##### Why
   * To open the door automatically for people.
 ##### How
   * These systems are used to open the door when a person comes near to the entrance of the door and closes it after he moves away from the door or after entering into the           door.
## Detail Requirements:
 ### High Level Requirements
 |  ID   |                Description
 |-------|------------------------------------------------------------------
 | HLR 1 | The Door should be Open automatically 
 | HLR 2 | It should sense the person when come closer the door
 | HLR 3 | It should be automatically closes after a specific time delay if there is no further motion near the door.
 
 ### Low Level Requirements
 | ID    |          Description
 |-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | LLR 1 | The system shall be able to open the door automatically, only for specific persons for security purpose
 | LLR 2 | The system shall be use customized auto door lock and unlock
 | LLR 3 | The system shall offers the additional advantage of tracking who enters the building and when they enter
 | LLR 4 | It shall be a simple wave of the hand near the sensor is all that is required to operate the switch to open the door.
## Advantages:
* There is lot of styling options in door openers.
* Convenience.
* For Safety and security purpose.
* Barrier free for wheelchair using persons, hygiene control, energy saving, environmental protection and hands free.

## Disadvantages:
*  When power goes off this system disables unless we have an inverter.
*  Installation and maintainance, needs to be clean regularly.
*  Pricing- It is more price compared to manual doors.
## Applications:
